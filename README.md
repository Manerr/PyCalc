# PyCalc
PyCalc is one pack of Python modules , port of Standard Library for omptimized use on Python Calculators .

It's an old and really unoptimized version I've made 4years ago
For a lot of programable calculators shipped with Python as a programming language (Numworks, TI 84, Casio Fx, ...) it could help the user getting more Python standard libraries (maybe not the most important ones though...)
